**Matter** is an industry-unifying standard that provides reliable and secure connectivity for smart-home devices. It is an IP-based connectivity protocol that works on Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Thread (over 802.15.4 radio) transports with Bluetooth LE being used for commissioning. The Matter standard is defined by the Connectivity Standards Alliance in association with all the industry leaders. 
  
**Espressif**, as a member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, is an active contributor to the development of the Matter protocol. Espressif, with its unique combination of connectivity **SoCs**, software, and complete solutions makes it easy for our customers to build Matter-enabled smart-home devices of various types. Espressif provides the most comprehensive solutions for Matter, including support for Wi-Fi or Thread end-point devices, Thread Border Routers, and Matter gateway reference designs.   
  
**Espressif’s SDK for Matter**  
Espressif’s SDK for Matter has been developed over the open-source Matter SDK to provide a simplified API and the required tools for building Matter-compatible devices with Espressif SoCs. This SDK defines periodic releases and support structures that ensure maintaining the in-field devices effectively.
