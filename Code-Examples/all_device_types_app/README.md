# All Device Types App

This is a All Device Types App using the ESP Matter data model. It covers all the device types that ESP
MATTER data model implements. It has been tested with multiple ecosystem Apple, Google, Alexa.

See the [docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/latest/esp32/developing.html) for more information about building and flashing the firmware.

**This example only implements mandatory clusters, attributes, commands, events, etc from the spec.**
If you want to add any optional data model bits please add them in [create api](https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter/blob/main/examples/all_device_types_app/main/esp_matter_console_helpers.cpp#L146) under your desired device type case using [data model creation development guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/latest/esp32/developing.html#developing-your-product).

## 1. Additional Environment Setup

No additional setup is required.

## 2. Usage

On boot-up esp-idf console starts. In order to create a device user have to use console command.

-   Use `create --device_type` to list all supported device types.
-   Use `create --device_type=on_off_light` to create light device.
-   To delete existing device perform `matter device factoryreset`.
-   To add new device, say fan or any other device type use `create --device_type=fan`.

Setup OTBR for a device

-   Please use the [OTBR board](https://github.com/espressif/esp-thread-br#hardware-platforms) as the harware platform running this example.
-   The sdkconfig file `sdkconfig.defaults.otbr` is provided to enable the OTBR feature on the device. Build and flash the example with the sdkconfig file 'sdkconfig.defaults.otbr'
```
idf.py -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults.otbr" set-target esp32s3 build
idf.py -p <PORT> erase-flash flash monitor

```
-   After pairing the device via ble-wifi method with chip-tool command, you can initialize a new Thread network dataset and commit it as the active one, user should use console command to do the below operation.
```
matter esp ot_cli dataset init new
matter esp ot_cli dataset commit active
matter esp ot_cli ifconfig up
matter esp ot_cli thread start
```
-   Get the operational dataset TLV-encoded string command
```
matter esp ot_cli dataset active -x

Done

```

You can simulate changing an attribute value locally using the command

-   Command to set attribute value: `matter esp attribute set <endpoint_id> <cluster_id> <attribute_id> <value>`
-   Command to get attribute value: `matter esp attribute get <endpoint_id> <cluster_id> <attribute_id>`


Refer examples/all_device_types_app/main/device_types.h for supported device types.

## 3. Post Commissioning Setup

No additional setup is required.
