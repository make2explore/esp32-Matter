# Managed Component Light

This example creates a Color Temperature Light device using the esp_matter component downloaded from [Espressif Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/) instead of the extra component in local, so the example can work without setting the esp-matter environment.

// TODO: IDF-9801
> Note: To prevent the hash problem during building, the version [IDF component management](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/) should be 1.4.*. Use `compote version` to show the version. Use `pip install 'idf-component-manager~=1.4.0'` to install.

See the [docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-matter/en/latest/esp32/developing.html) for more information about building and flashing the firmware.
